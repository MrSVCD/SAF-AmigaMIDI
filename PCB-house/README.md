# SAF-AmigaMIDI-CNC
# Not complete.
A somewhat faithful recreation of the Amiga MIDI interface from "ST Amiga Format" issue 5 for sending of to a PCB house/manufacturer.
This version is going to take advantage of dual sided PCB design.
This version might include a upgraded RS232 interface, taking advantage of the -12v available on the Amigas serial port.
